Final Exam Example
This final exam exemplifies a common structure of an in-class exam. It is broken into four sections and each section focuses on one aspect of the class. Part one emphasizes literary theory and genre issues, the second requires students to discuss important passages/quotes from the texts, the third focuses on plot and other literary devices, and the last section consists of a few short essays which reinforce important concepts from the class. This exam provides students with a chance to earn a few extra credit points for knowing some of the more obscure information discussed in class.
